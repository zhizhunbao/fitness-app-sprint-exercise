Sprint Planning Class Exercise


Duration: 60 minutes

Objective: Students will practice sprint planning by working in teams to plan a two-week sprint, estimate tasks, and allocate them across a 5-person team.

Scenario/Use Case: A mobile app for managing personal fitness goals.


Sprint Planning Exercise: Building a Personal Fitness App


Use Case:

You are part of a team developing a mobile app called FitLife, which helps users set, track, and achieve personal fitness goals such as losing weight, increasing stamina, or building muscle.


The focus of this sprint is to develop the User Dashboard and Goal-Setting Module, as well as to implement a basic Progress Tracking feature.


User Stories for the Sprint:

1. User Story 1: As a user, I want to create a profile with personal details (e.g., age, weight, height, and fitness goals), so that I can track my progress.


2. User Story 2: As a user, I want to set fitness goals (e.g., weight loss, strength training, cardio), so that I can plan my fitness journey.


3. User Story 3: As a user, I want to see a summary of my current goals and activities on my dashboard, so that I can monitor my progress easily.


4. User Story 4: As a user, I want to log my daily exercise and dietary habits, so that I can track how my activities contribute to my fitness goals.


5. User Story 5: As a user, I want to receive a weekly progress report, so that I can stay motivated and make adjustments to my routine.


Exercise Steps:


1. Sprint Planning (20 minutes):

- Provide the teams with the 4 user stories listed above.

- Ask each team to perform the following tasks:

1. Break Down the User Stories into Tasks: Identify all the tasks required to implement each user story.

2. Estimate Effort: Using story points (or hours, if preferred), estimate the effort for each task.

3. Prioritize User Stories: Ask teams to prioritize the user stories based on business value and complexity.


3. Capacity Planning (10 minutes):

- Each team should account for the availability of each team member over the 2-week sprint (assuming full-time availability, with some buffer for unplanned issues).

- The team will then assign tasks to each member, ensuring the total capacity aligns with the sprint goals.


4. Sprint Backlog Creation (15 minutes):

- Each team should create a sprint backlog that lists the tasks they plan to complete in the sprint.

- Ensure the sprint backlog can realistically be completed in two weeks.


5. Sprint Planning Presentation (10 minutes):

- Each team should present their sprint backlog to the class, explaining their:

1. Breakdown of tasks per user story.

2. Effort estimates.

3. Task prioritization.

4. Allocation of work across the team.


6. Class Discussion & Feedback (10-15 minutes):

- Facilitate a discussion where students provide feedback on the plans presented.

- Focus on:

1. How well teams estimated and allocated tasks.

2. Whether the backlog aligns with the teamâ€™s capacity.

3. How priorities were handled.
